## MyRecipes Dev Information
### Getting Started

With GitHub Desktop download the project files.

### NodeJs & npm
You will need to install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v14.17.5. 
This will also install npm which you will need to install packages.

Once they have been installed, open command prompt/terminal, navigate to the project folder and run:
```
npm install
```
This should install everything you need to get started.

### Running the website
To run the website, open command prompt/terminal inside the project folder and run: 
```
nodemon myrecipes
```
This should run the server without errors.

Then in your browser type:
```
localhost:3000
```

To stop the server cleanly hold: ```ctrl+c / cmd+c``` while inside command prompt / terminal.
